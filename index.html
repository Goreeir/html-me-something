            <h1> What I'm learning from minimalist.</h1>
        </header>
        <main>
            <p>I first learned about minimalism about 5 years ago &#38; boy has it changed my outlook on life. Before, I was obsived with how much more I could gain. I would get one thing, and immediely look for the next. This led me to an apartment full of stuff but I was misterable. While I never reacher horder status, I sure felt like I could relate. Thankfully minimalism came into my live and everyhing changed. </p>
            <p>It seems that minimalist are having their moment. There are documinaries, podcast, blogs, &#38; even magaizines dedicated to it. Which all of the info floating around, its still hard to know what exactly minimalism is. Joshua Becker once said "At its core, minimalism is the intentional promotion of the things we most value &#38; the removal of everything that distracts us from it.", &#38; I think he sumed it up quite nicely</p>

            <h3> Here's what I learned </h3>
            <ol>
                <li> Less stuff equals less work.</li>
                    <p> Every single thing that you own requires work to mainting it. That new iphone (you have to remeber to charge it.), your clothes (must be washed, dried &#38; mayne even <b>ironed!</b>). I could go on &#38; on. Your house, car, shoes, computer, oven. Anything you can think of requires some type of responsibility or work to go along with it. When you take the journey of letting go of the things that don't actually bring value to your life, you free up so much engery for things that you actually care about. </p>
                <li> Having space is so calming. </li>
                    <p>Currently, my appartment is one of my favoite places to be. It wasn't always like that though. Before thaking this journey, my apartment was a place that reminded me of all of the things I had to do &#38; my brain when bannans. All I could think about was unread books, unfinished journals, and unwatched movies. Now, my home is a place of joy. I'm sourounded by the things I love but more importantly I have space. I can exercise, do yoga, mediate, or just breath. I finally have the physical and mental space and really enjoy being home. </p>
                <li> Simple things can bring joy</li>
                    <p>Do you know the feeling you get when getting your favorite coffee? &#9749;   Perhaps you can relate to the happy feeling you get when the sun finilly come out after a long winter? These are simple things that make us happy. Wanna know a secret? These things happen all of the time. I mean several times a day, several time per hour. No,I'm not joking. I'm being honest.Why don't people notice you ask? Well, its because all of the "stuff" gets in the way. When we take time to get rid of all of the junk in our lives, you;ll be suprised by all of the simple delights that remain.</p>
                    <p></p>
                <li> Having less clothing can be stylish. </li>
                    <a> One of my favorite minimalist is Caroline from </a> <a href "http://www.un-fancy.com/capsule-wardrobe-101/how-to-build-a-capsule-wardrobe/"> Un-fancy.</a> <a> Let's just be honest, the girl's got style. How does she do it? Well, I'm glad you asked. Each season she chose 37 pieces of clothing to wear. Sound borning? Yeah, it did to me too...until I saw her wardrob. Appartently when you only have 37 things to wear, you make sure you love each &#38; every piece. This, in turn, leads to 365 days of style. Don't believe me? Take a look at these photos: </a>

            <p> My minimalist journey is  a work in process but I hope the lessons I have learned are just at helpful to you as they are to me. </p>
